# Cheating System:

This system is designed to monitor students' behavior during exams and determine whether a student is cheating, along with the extent of cheating. It addresses the ease with which students can now cheat using various methods, which compromises the integrity of the data and hinders the ability to generate accurate and effective insights.

The scenarios handled by the system include:
## 1.If the student frequently turns their head in different directions (right, left, up, or down).
## 2.If the student uses a mobile phone.
## 3.If another person is present with the student.
## 4.If the student leaves the exam or attempts to cover the camera.
## 5.If the student opens another tab during the exam.

A detailed report is generated for each student, outlining their behavior during the exam. This report helps the institution derive meaningful insights and take informed decisions.
