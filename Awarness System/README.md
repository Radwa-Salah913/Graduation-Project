# Awarness System:
This system is designed to monitor students' focus, attention, and engagement during sessions by analyzing specific metrics, such as:

## 1.Whether the student is using their mobile phone during the session.
## 2.Whether the student is sleeping during the session.
## 3.Whether there are other people present in the same room during the session.
## 4.Whether the student leaves the session while it is still ongoing.
## 5.Whether the student attempts to cover the camera, as they cannot disable it from their device.

Using these observations, the system calculates the student's overall concentration level during the session.
 Finally, it generates a detailed report for each student, outlining all the recorded metrics.
