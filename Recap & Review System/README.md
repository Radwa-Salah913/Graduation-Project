# Recap & Review System:

The system is designed to significantly enhance comprehension and engagement during educational or professional sessions by providing advanced features for summarizing and organizing information. It automatically generates detailed session summaries, capturing the key points and critical takeaways from discussions or lectures. Additionally, it facilitates learning and collaboration by creating structured notes, which can be referenced easily for future study or review.

To further support comprehension, the system can generate contextual questions based on the session content, along with their corresponding answers. This helps participants to evaluate their understanding of the material and clarify complex topics.

These capabilities are powered by advanced large language models (LLMs) such as Deepseek, T5, and MiniLM, which are utilized to process and synthesize text with high accuracy and relevance. Furthermore, the integration of speech-to-text technology, such as OpenAI's Whisper, ensures that spoken content from live sessions or recordings is seamlessly transcribed into written text, enabling the system to handle audio input effectively.

By combining cutting-edge natural language processing (NLP) and speech recognition technologies, the system offers a comprehensive solution to streamline learning, enhance productivity, and improve overall understanding of session content.
